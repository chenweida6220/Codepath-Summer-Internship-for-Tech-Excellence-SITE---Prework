## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Having learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS in high school, I found the frontend aspects of the assignment quite simple and intuitive. Luckily enough, I did not have any major difficulties until I touched JavaScript. Although JavaScript is not similar to the programming language Java, I should have known the two were not meant to be confused together. JavaScript code is run by text and needs only to be interpreted while Java code must be compiled. My first major mistake was associating the two programming languages. Once I had the syntax between JavaScript and Java mixed up, it was hard untangling the two apart and I had a lot of difficulties un-associating the syntax between the languages. While I was doing the assignment and found out that the syntax I had written was not JavaScript-readable, the console kept spamming out errors whenever it was run, making it hard to differentiate what exactly went wrongâ€”was it the use of functions? Did I reference something when I did not have to? Did I make a noob mistake and forget a small piece of code? To me personally, JavaScript looks a lot like Java with the use of objects throughout its codebase, and for that, I paid the price.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Completing this assignment made me think about the huge number of things one can potentially incorporate into a website. For example, the assignment we were tasked with had us write a 2D game built onto a webpage. I wonder if the possibilities of incorporating more games with much more powerful infrastructures can be built onto a webpage instead of, say, downloading it as a separate application. Would it not be much simpler keeping it on a website than downloading a whole load of gigabyte packages of a game? If the issue is concerning internet traffic, is there not a way to divert that traffic to each host? These are the types of questions I want to find out when taking part in the Summer 2022 Codepath summer internship.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would like to find out a way to configure the frequency of the pitch whenever a button is pressed and if possible, make a chord of tones of different frequencies instead of a single constant tone. I am intrigued by the mathematics behind the creation of a sound just from a webpage so if I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely look up a course on creating audio from Web Audio API.]
